# EVD 7 — Undergraduate Researcher Onboarding Timeline

## Evidence Statement

All three undergraduate researchers generated an original result from their analysis projects within ~4 months of joining the lab, with two creating a result within ~1 month.

## Evidence Description

The onboarding timeline was reconstructed for three undergraduate researchers by tracing key milestones through their daily notes and the discourse graph: (1) first day in lab, (2) first experiment reference in daily notes, (3) first plot (linked image in notes), and (4) first formal RES node creation. Dates were extracted from Roam Research page metadata and daily log entries.

Researcher A joined the lab on February 23, 2024 and claimed their first experiment (`@analysis/Quantify the percentage of simulated endocytic events that assemble detectable amounts of actin`) on April 5, 2024 (41 days). They produced their first plot on June 20, 2024 (118 days) and first RES node on June 27, 2024 (125 days). This represents a self-directed exploration pathway where the student browsed the Issues board and claimed an experiment matching their interests.

Researcher B joined on October 10, 2024 and was assigned an entry project (`@analysis/Plot the number of bound Hip1R over time for different Arp2/3 distributions in endocytosis simulations`) explicitly designed "to get acquainted with our simulations and the analysis framework." They began work on October 15, 2024 (5 days), producing plots the same day. Their first RES node was created November 26, 2024 (47 days).

Researcher C joined on June 23, 2025 and was assigned to an existing experiment (`@analysis/correlate segmented endocytic spots to cell location (apical, basal, lateral) in 3D`) via the "Possible Contributors" field. They began work on June 30, 2025 (7 days), produced first plots on July 7, 2025 (14 days), and created their first RES node on July 29, 2025 (36 days) — the fastest time-to-result among the three.

The mean time-to-first-RES for undergraduate researchers (69 days) was faster than the overall lab average (88.3 days), suggesting that structured onboarding pathways — whether through assigned entry projects or direct experiment assignment — accelerate early productivity while maintaining result quality.

**Figure 7. Undergraduate researcher onboarding timeline in the MATSUlab discourse graph.** Gantt-style chart showing the progression of three anonymized undergraduate researchers (A, B, C) from lab start to first formal result (RES node). Horizontal bars indicate phases: blue = onboarding (first day to first experiment reference), green = development (first experiment to first plot), purple = result production (first plot to first RES). Colored markers indicate milestones: black = first day, red = first experiment, orange = first plot, green = first RES. Numbers above markers show days from lab start. Researcher A followed a self-directed exploration pathway (41 days to experiment, 125 days to RES). Researcher B was assigned an entry project (5 days to experiment, 47 days to RES). Researcher C was directly assigned to an existing experiment (7 days to experiment, 36 days to RES). All three pathways successfully produced formal results within 4 months, with structured assignment pathways yielding faster time-to-result.
