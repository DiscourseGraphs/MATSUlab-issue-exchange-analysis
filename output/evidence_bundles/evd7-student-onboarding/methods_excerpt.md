# Methods Excerpt (EVD 7)

This excerpt describes the methodology for the undergraduate researcher onboarding timeline analysis. See `data/student_milestones.json` for current milestone data.

---

## 1. Overview

Unlike EVD 1 and EVD 5, this analysis is a manually curated case study rather than an automated pipeline output. Three undergraduate researchers were tracked from lab entry to first formal result (RES node) creation.

**Implementation:** `src/student_timeline_analysis.py`

---

## 2. Milestone Definition

Four milestones were tracked for each researcher:

| Milestone | Definition | Detection method |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **First day in lab** | The researcher's official start date | PI records / lab onboarding date |
| **First experiment** | First reference to an experiment page (`@analysis/...` or `@experiment/...`) in the researcher's daily notes | Manual review of daily notes in Roam Research |
| **First plot** | First linked image (plot or figure) appearing in the researcher's daily notes or experiment pages | Manual review of daily notes and experiment page content |
| **First RES node** | Creation date of the researcher's first formal `[[RES]]` page in the discourse graph | `created` field from JSON-LD export or Roam page metadata |

---

## 3. Date Extraction

Milestone dates were manually extracted by reviewing daily notes and experiment page metadata in Roam Research. They are not computationally derived from the graph export. Dates reflect the analyst's (PI's) judgment about when each milestone was first reached.

**Days-from-start** values are computed as:

```
days = (milestone_date - first_day_in_lab).days
```

## 4. Onboarding Pathway Classification

Each researcher was assigned a pathway label based on the PI's recollection of how they were onboarded:

| Pathway | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Self-directed exploration** | Researcher browsed the Issues board independently and claimed an experiment matching their interests |
| **Assigned entry project** | Researcher was assigned a specific experiment designed to introduce the lab's analysis framework |
| **Direct assignment** | Researcher was added as a contributor to an existing experiment via the `Possible Contributors::` field |

These labels are post-hoc classifications, not properties inferred from the discourse graph structure.

---

## 5. Lab Average Comparison

The lab-wide average time-to-first-result (88.3 days) is drawn from the Time-to-First-Result metric computed in `src/calculate_metrics.py` across all researchers with at least one linked RES node. This population includes faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates across the full history of the graph, and is therefore not directly comparable to the undergraduate-only mean (69.3 days).

---

## 6. Visualization

The timeline visualization is generated by `src/student_timeline_analysis.py`, which produces:

- `fig7_student_timelines.png` — Static matplotlib figure
- `fig7_student_timelines.html` — Interactive HTML/JS version with hover details

Researcher identities are anonymized as A, B, C in all outputs via `src/anonymize.py`.
