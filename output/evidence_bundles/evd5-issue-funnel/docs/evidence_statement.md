# EVD 5 — Issue-to-Experiment-to-Result Conversion Funnel

## Evidence Statement

Of 389 total issues in the MATSUlab discourse graph, 69 (18%) were claimed as experiments and 25 (6%) produced at least one formal result node, yielding 44 total RES nodes (avg 1.8 per result-producing experiment).

## Evidence Description

The issue-to-result funnel was constructed by tracking the attrition of issues through three stages: creation, claim, and result production. All 389 identifiable issues (320 formal ISS nodes plus 0 experiment pages with inferred claims) formed the top of the funnel. Of these, 69 (18%) were claimed through any mechanism — 0 explicit claims (with `Claimed By::` field), 0 inferred claims (experimental log entries by the page creator), and 0 ISS pages with experimental log activity. This represents a 18% issue-to-experiment conversion rate.

Of the 69 claimed experiments, 25 (36%) had at least one linked RES (Result) node, representing experiments that produced a formally recorded result. The remaining 44 claimed experiments either have work still in progress or recorded their outputs in formats other than formal `[[RES]]` pages. The 25 result-producing experiments generated a total of 44 RES nodes, averaging 1.8 results per experiment. Overall, 6% of all issues progressed through the full funnel from creation to formal result production.

## Figure Legend

**Figure 5. Issue-to-experiment-to-result flow in the MATSUlab discourse graph.** Alluvial (Sankey) diagram showing all 69 claimed experiments flowing through three stages: Issue Created (left, who created the issue), Issue Claimed (center, who claimed the experiment), and Result Created (right, who created the first formal result). Band width is proportional to the number of experiments. Green bands indicate self-claims (same person created the issue and claimed the experiment); purple bands indicate cross-person claims (idea exchange, where a different researcher claimed the issue). Of the 69 claimed experiments, 25 produced at least one formal result node, yielding 44 total RES nodes. Researcher names are anonymized (R1–R11); the PI (Matt Akamatsu) is identified. An interactive HTML version (`fig5_alluvial_flow.html`) allows hovering to inspect individual flows.
